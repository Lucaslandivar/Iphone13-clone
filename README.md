<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I always liked the design of the iphone pages, and once i start programing, i always wonder how to make the images change by selecting the colors, so i decide to make this project to learno about it. My goal with this project was make a responsive and functional website by using html, css and javascript, and i wanted to make it very similar to the actual iphone page.</p> 

<h2>Why i make this project?</h2>
<p>I make this project so i can learn more about javascript and make a better website.</p>

<h2>How does this project work?</h2>
<P>The main function of this project is: when the user choose the color, automatically the image of the iphone changes to the color the user selected. I made it possible by naming the id of the button colors with the same name of the images.</p>

<h2>Status</h2>
